# Maze(Client-server edition)
Maze generator by Toxe:  https://github.com/Toxe/maze-generator (No I did not ask for permission sorry)
Base code for the maze by my teacher (Github name: Sunmeat): https://github.com/sunmeat/maze

Currently, this code has a bug, which causes the connection to fail at the last step of gameplay (when the server is trying to tell the client that the exit attempt is valid)
I have tried everything that I could, and I still don't know how to fix this (or even what the cause actually is)
